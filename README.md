# rna_seq_dge_analysis

This report analyzes a count matrix generated from RNA-seq reads, which are obtained from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of NCBI. The sequence reads are aligned to reference genome using STAR for reads quantification of each gene. The purpose of this analysis is to identify genes that are differentially expressed between groups under different conditions.
